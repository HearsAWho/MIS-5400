For my final project I will be gathering all Real Estate Investment Trust's (REIT's) that are publicly traded and determine which ones are worth investing in. I have found a website that displays a mostly clean table of them that is refreshed weekly. I have scraped the desired info(using urllib3),  and stored it in a local database (using sqlite3), I will then filter out the reits that don't show promise as a profitable investment based on predetermined requirements. Once I have reduced my list I will scrape additional quantifiers (Dividend history) and expose the results through website with visual aids (from matplotlib / pandas / jupyter notebook).
